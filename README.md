### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced software and machine learning engineer. I have experience writing scalable and secure web applications.

My free time is spent mostly writing code and gardening. I also think and write about food security and regional crop adaptability.

I post cool stuff to https://butterwick.tech sometimes
